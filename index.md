Hello, and welcome to my webpage! 

I am currently working as an economist at the DG for Economics, Statistics and Research of the Bank of Italy, Firms and regional analysis Division  

In 2020 I received a PhD in Economics from the LSE, where I worked under the supervision of [Steve Pischke](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/pischke/) and [Steve Machin](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/machin/)
